// Week 1 CODE CHALLENGE
Project set-up: The project is within the "src" folder which contains 3 files, namely: Detector.js, Net Salary.js and Student grade.js. In addition there are also 3 single files present; index.html, style.css and a README.md

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator: This program prompts the user to input the student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector. This program takes the inputof the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and then proceed to print the total number of demerit points the driver has received.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator. Given the basic salary and benefits of a particular employee,the program then proceeds to calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary. All the results are then printed below after in one go.
